Problem: SAM file contains duplicated sequences
Solution: remove duplicates and check UMIs

import all the things

open SAM for read
open UMI for read
open newSAM for write

for line in UMI
	append UMI to UMIlist: list

Create seqtrack: list #this will hold known sequences

for each line in SAM #until lines no longer start with @ symbol
	header: string += all lines that start with @ 

write header to newSAM file

for each line in SAM #after header
	Create seqlist: list #temporary 
	Split(\t) columns into list [0-11] (QNAME, FLAG, RNAME, etc)
	11 holds all data after quality column (not mandatory for SAM)
	seqlist = [the, split, list, of, columns]
	
	seqlist[0] = checkumi(seqlist[0]) -> string  #pass qname to checkumi() since it holds the UMI
	
	if seqlist[0] is not 0   #this means the UMI was preserved or corrected	
		if sequence or seqlist[10] not in seqtrack #meaning the sequence is not a duplicate
			add sequence to seqtrack
				append seqlist to new SAM file, tab separated
	
#check hamming distance for the UMI against UMIlist, discard any hams > 1
function checkumi(qname: string) -> string
	if qname[:8] is found in UMIlist:
		return qname because UMI is valid
	else if qname[:8] is not found in UMIlist: 
		for umi in UMIlist #check hamming distance of all UMIs
			ham = 0
			for i in range(8):
				if qname[i] != umi[i]:
					ham + 1
			if ham < 2 (meaning if the string has less than 2 different characters)
				replace qname[:8] with current UMI
				return qname
		return 0 #no matches, UMI is invalid
