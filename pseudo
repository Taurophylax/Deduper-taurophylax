Problem: SAM file contains duplicated sequences
Solution: remove duplicates and check UMIs

import all the things

open SAM for read
open UMI for read
open newSAM for write

for line in UMI
	append UMI to UMIlist: list

Example: UMIlist = [AACGGCAT, AATCGCTT, ATTCC...]

create postrack: list #list of positions

Example: postrack = [76739782, 76875967, 76708822 ...]

for each line in SAM #until lines no longer start with @ symbol
	header: string += all lines that start with @ 

write header to newSAM file

duplicates = 0 #counter

for each line in SAM #after header
	Create seqlist: list
	Split(\t) columns into list [0-11] Example: [QNAME, FLAG, RNAME, etc] : all strings
												11 = all data after quality column (not mandatory for SAM)
	seqlist = [the, split, list, of, columns]
	cigar = seqlist[5] 
	position = seqlist[3]
	
	if bitflag shows strand
		set current strand
		
	if cigar contains an 's' (soft clip) as the first a-z character
		pull integer that preceeds s (unless s is at the end, then what?)
		position = position +/- value of s.... do math based on strand?
	
	if position is in postrack[] #meaning the sequence is a duplicate
			duplicates += 1
			go to next line
		else # sequence not found yet
			seqlist[0] = checkumi(seqlist[0]) -> string
			if seqlist[0] is not 0 #UMI was preserved or corrected	
				add position to postrack
				append seqlist to new SAM file, tab separated #write the record to the new sam file

print(duplicates + " duplicates found) #end output
	
#check hamming distance for the UMI against UMIlist, discard any hams > 1
function checkumi(qname: string) -> string
	if qname[:8] is found in UMIlist:
		return qname because UMI is valid
	else if qname[:8] is not found in UMIlist: 
		for umi in UMIlist #check hamming distance of all UMIs
			ham = 0
			for i in range(8):
				if qname[i] != umi[i]:
					ham + 1
				
					Example:  ATCG (good UMI) & ATTG (our UMI), ham = 1, our UMI is likely ATCG and not ATTG
					Example:  ATCG (good UMI) & CAAC (our UMI), ham = 4, our UMI is likely invalid
					
			if ham < 2 (meaning if the string has 1 or 0 different characters)
				replace qname[:8] with correct UMI
				return qname
		return 0 #no matches, UMI is invalid
		
OUTPUT: newSAM.sam
CONSOLE: 392 duplicates found
